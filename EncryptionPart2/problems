* key storage
	i'm thinking jobID-public/private key as key-value pair	
	but how to use hashmap of non-primitive types as attributes in touchcore...?
	if we cannot do that how to store keys?
	*maybe we should do 3-des which does not involve storing the keys lol*

* passing input parameters
	on second thought, the wrapper method does not allow access of the input parameters (maybe it's a touchcore problem)
